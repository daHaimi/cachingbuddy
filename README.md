# CachingBuddy
ESP8266-based low-tech caching device.

Intended for Geocaching as group activity.

The texts are in german only currently, sorry for that, but I extracted all tests to a separate header file.

## Features
* Display Cache details on OLED display incl. course/distance to cache
* LED-Ring compass towards cache
* Cache itearation with support up to 255 caches
* Management via HTML-Interface. Access via QR-URL possible

### Geocaches
The **CachingBuddy** uses the *SPIFF* capabilites of the ESP8266 to store the geocaches in the default GPX-format, as they can be downloaded from geocaching.com. The maximum supported number of Caches on the device has been set to **128** as more do not seem to make sense for a single tour.

The implementation allows even to use Mystery-Caches (As their coordinates are updated after solving them) and muti-caches:

_Multi-Caches_ have multiple waypoints. **CachingBuddy** has been implemented to support up to **32** waypoints per cache.

## Components

### Hardware
* ESP8266 on a WeMos D1 Mini board
* GPS Sensor: Beitian BN-220
* Compass: 24-LED Ring CJMCV-2812-24
* Display: 128 x 64 Pixel 1.3" OLED with SH1106 I2C controller
* Buttons: 12 x 12 x 7.3mm SMD buttons
* Mini DC-DC step down converter (Using 2 18650 LiIon Batteries)

### Software
* Arduino with default libraries, e.g. `Adafruit_NeoPixel`
